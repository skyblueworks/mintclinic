## What are aligners?

Aligners are made from thin, **_clear material_** that fits snugly over the teeth. They are created _**individually**_ for each patient based on a digitalized impression to ensure precise and comfortable fit. The set of aligners is changed every 1-2 weeks, with each new tray slightly moving the teeth toward the desired position.

### Benefits of aligners

- **Transparency -** Unlike metal braces, aligners are **_almost invisible_**, making them an excellent choice for people who want to correct their smile without attracting attention.
- **Comfort -** Aligners are made from soft and smooth material, which reduces the risk of irritation to the gums and lips, commonly associated with traditional braces.
- **Removability -** They can be easily removed when eating or cleaning your teeth, allowing for **_better_** _**oral hygiene**_ and the freedom to consume your favorite foods.
- **Treatment precision -** Thanks to modern technologies such as digital planning, treatment with aligners is extremely **_accurate and predictable_**.

## How do aligners work?

Treatment with aligners begins with a detailed examination and digital treatment plan. The dentist or orthodontist creates a **_virtual model_** of your teeth and plans the steps for their movement. The patient receives a set of aligners that should be worn **_approximately 22 hours a day_**, removing them only when eating and cleaning the teeth.

Every _**1-2 weeks**_ the patient switches to a new aligner, with each subsequent tray slightly correcting the position of the teeth. The entire process can take anywhere from several months to a year or more, depending on the complexity of the case.

### Aligner maintenance

**Regular cleaning -** Aligners should be cleaned daily to avoid plaque and bacteria buildup. It's best to rinse them with cool water and use a brush for cleaning.

**Regular dental visits -** To monitor treatment progress, it's recommended to visit your dentist for regular check-ups.

### Disadvantages of aligners

**Require discipline -** Since aligners are removable, patients must be disciplined and wear them almost constantly to achieve the desired results.

**Limited correction for complex cases -** Although aligners are suitable for correcting many orthodontic problems, they are not appropriate for the most complex cases of teeth misalignment, which may require traditional braces.
