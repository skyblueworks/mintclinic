        "The best approach for long-lasting and optimal results is a combination of both procedures – starting with professional in-office whitening followed by at-home maintenance. First, in-office whitening provides an intense and immediate effect that quickly brightens your teeth. Then, with the help of at-home whitening, you continue to maintain the achieved results and extend the effect over time.",

## When is Whitening Not Suitable?

- **Severely damaged or worn teeth -** If your teeth have significant structural damage, cracks, or cavities, whitening may cause additional irritation or sensitivity. In these cases, it's important to address these issues first.
- **Fillings, crowns, or veneers -** Whitening agents do not affect colored materials such as fillings, crowns, or veneers. If you have these in your front teeth, alternatives may need to be considered, as whitening may create a color difference between natural teeth and restorations.
- **Sensitive teeth -** If you suffer from increased tooth sensitivity, whitening may intensify this problem. In such cases, it's advisable to discuss alternative treatment.
- **Teeth with severe pigmentation -** Some types of stains, such as those caused by antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline), may be more difficult to whiten.

Teeth whitening is a safe and effective procedure. Before starting any whitening procedure, our specialists will perform a thorough examination of your teeth to ensure that whitening is suitable for you.
