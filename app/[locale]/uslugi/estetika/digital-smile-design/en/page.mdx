## What is a Smile Transformation?

A smile transformation is a comprehensive process that includes **cosmetic** and **functional** corrections to achieve the perfect balance between aesthetics, health, and function. Using procedures such as veneers, teeth whitening, crowns, and dental implants, we transform your smile to be not only beautiful but also **long-lasting**.

### Digital Smile Design: Visualize Your Results in Advance

One of the main advantages of modern smile transformation is the use of Digital Smile Design (DSD). This innovative technology allows us to create a **digital model** of your future smile before any procedure begins. With the help of 3D modeling and software, we design a smile that will match your **facial features** and fulfill your aesthetic goals.

## Mock-up Test: Try Your New Smile

After creating the digital model, an important stage follows – the **mock-up** test. This represents a **temporary model** of your new smile that will be placed on your teeth for testing in real conditions. The **mock-up** test gives you the unique opportunity to **feel and see** how you will look with your new smile, providing you with the **possibility for adjustments** before the final treatment.
