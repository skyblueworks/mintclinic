## What is Bonding?

The procedure involves applying a **composite material** that bonds directly to the tooth surface without requiring prior filing. Most commonly, the dentist models the teeth **directly in the mouth**. It's also possible for the design to be prepared by a dental technician, which extends the procedure time.

### Benefits

- **Quick procedure:** In most cases, bonding can be completed in just one visit to the clinic.
- **Flexibility:** The design is done by hand and can be **modified at any time** until you achieve the desired effect.
- **Non-invasive:** There's no need to remove a significant amount of tooth tissue, making the procedure gentle.
- **Aesthetic results:** The materials used in bonding are high-quality and provide a natural appearance.
- **Affordable price:** Compared to other cosmetic procedures, bonding is a more accessible option.

## Maintenance After the Procedure

Since composite materials are relatively soft, they wear faster than ceramic alternatives. Bonding loses its shine, which is why annual polishing by a specialist is necessary. Of course, home maintenance is also essential.

### How Long Does Bonding Last?

The average lifespan is **3 to 9 years**, depending on the patient's care and habits. A major advantage of bonding is that it can be **repeated**, or replaced with a more durable alternative – **veneers**.
