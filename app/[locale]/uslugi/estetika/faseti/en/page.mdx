## What Are Veneers?

Veneers are **thin porcelain shells** that are attached to the front surface of your teeth to improve their **color, shape, and alignment**. They are an excellent choice for people with **worn, discolored, eroded**, or **misaligned teeth**. Porcelain veneers not only enhance the **aesthetics** of your smile but also protect teeth from further damage.

### Benefits of Porcelain Veneers

- **Perfect aesthetic appearance:** Veneers have an exceptionally natural look and can be customized to match the color and shape of your remaining teeth.
- **Durable and long-lasting:** Porcelain veneers are made from high-quality materials that can last many years with proper care.
- **Quick transformation:** Unlike orthodontics, which can take years, veneers provide visible transformation after just a few visits.
- **Minimal tooth intervention:** In most cases, veneer placement requires **minimal shaping** of the tooth surface to create space for the veneers. If there is none, preparation is skipped - the so-called **no-prep** technique.

## Who Are They Suitable For?

Veneers are extremely **fine craftsmanship**, whose success depends heavily on the strength of the bond with the tooth and the contacts with the others, so there are several conditions before placing them. The teeth must have **preserved structural integrity**. If a tooth has a large filling or root canal treatment, then a crown should be placed on it. But rest assured - it will be indistinguishable from the other veneers. It is important that all **static and dynamic contacts** are corrected, which could lead to fracture or debonding of the veneers, so you can enjoy them as long as possible.

Schedule a consultation and discover how **veneers** can transform your smile and yourself!
