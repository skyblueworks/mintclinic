## Gingivitis and Periodontitis | Treatment and Prevention of Gum Disease

**Gingivitis** and **periodontitis** are among the most common problems in the oral cavity. They begin with _**gum inflammation**_ and can lead to serious complications, including _**tooth loss**_, if not treated in time. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment can _**stop the progression**_ of the diseases and restore gum health.

## What is gingivitis?

Gingivitis is the initial stage of gum disease, caused by the accumulation of plaque and bacteria on the teeth and gums. The main symptoms include:

- Red and swollen gums
- Bleeding when brushing teeth or flossing
- Bad breath

This disease is _**irreversible**_, but can be _**controlled**_ with proper treatment and maintenance.

## Treatment of gingivitis

The treatment of gingivitis is aimed at removing the plaque and bacteria that cause gum inflammation. The main steps include:

- **Professional teeth cleaning -** The dentist removes accumulated plaque and tartar through a procedure called scaling.
- **Improved oral hygiene -** Brushing teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and using dental floss to remove plaque between teeth.
- **Antiseptic mouthwashes -** Using antibacterial mouthwashes that help reduce inflammation and destroy bacteria.

With proper treatment and care, gingivitis can be completely cured.

## Treatment of periodontitis

Periodontitis requires more intensive treatment, as it affects not only the gums but also the _**bone around the teeth**_. After initial diagnosis, the severity of the disease is assessed and the patient **_follows a two-year treatment plan_**, with cleaning intervals determined by the **_degree of progression_**. The main treatment methods include:

- **Deep cleaning (curettage and root planing) -** Removal of bacteria and tartar from the root surfaces of the teeth and below the gum line. This helps the gum to **_adhere tightly_** to the tooth surface and prevent bacteria from penetrating deeper.
- **Surgical treatment -** In some cases, when periodontitis does not respond to treatment, surgical intervention is necessary. As an intervention, it is quite mild and any fears are unjustified.
- **Antiseptic mouthwashes -** Using antibacterial mouthwashes that help reduce inflammation and destroy bacteria.
