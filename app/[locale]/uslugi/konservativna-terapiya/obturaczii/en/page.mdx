## Dental Fillings (Restorations)

Fillings are one of the most common procedures in dentistry, used for _**restoring teeth**_ after cavities, fractures or other damage. They restore both the functionality and aesthetics of the tooth.

## Filling Placement Process

The procedure for placing a filling begins with **_removal of the damaged part of the tooth_** and cleaning the area of bacteria. Then a _**composite resin**_ is applied and shaped to restore the form and functionality of the tooth. Composite fillings are hardened using a special light, and the bond with the tooth structure is _**extremely strong**_. However, fillings _**do not make**_ the tooth more resistant to subsequent fractures.

## Long-lasting Solutions: Ceramic Inlay or Onlay

If a filling fails and needs to be replaced frequently, ceramic alternatives are an excellent choice. They are more resistant to wear and stains and have a significantly longer lifespan. Ceramics combine durability and aesthetics, remaining virtually unnoticeable in the mouth.
