## What is Root Canal Treatment?

**Root canal treatment** is a procedure designed to save a strategically important tooth whose pulp, containing the tooth's nerve and blood vessels, is exposed or inflamed. When infection reaches it, we remove it, clean and fill the root canals.

## Why Choose Our Clinic?

At Mint, we use **the latest technologies**, including a **dental microscope**, which allows us to perform root canal treatment with _**maximum precision**_. This instrument is particularly useful _**in complex cases**_, providing us the ability to see and work with details that might otherwise be missed.

We work almost entirely _**mechanically**_, which drastically reduces treatment time. It also standardizes the process, guaranteeing us _**predictable, reliable results**_ every time.

Our patients typically need only **two visits**:

- **Root canal preparation:** Cleaning the root canals, removing the infection. The canals are **_filled with medication_** that aims to kill any remaining microorganisms that survived the initial disinfection.
- **Root canal filling:** Filling the canals with material that prevents reinfection.

## What Follows After Root Canal Treatment

It is widespread practice for teeth with endodontic treatment to be **_covered with crowns_**, as their structural integrity is compromised and they are **_prone to fractures_**. If a tooth is already deeply fractured, in many cases it can be **_rebuilt_** with the help of a **_dental post_**. The reconstruction is performed at least a day and a half after the definitive filling of the tooth.

## Retreatment

It is possible for an already treated tooth to become infected again. This most commonly occurs through the infiltration of **_bacteria through micro-gaps_** (microleakage), or **_surviving bacteria_** in the root canal during the primary treatment. In such cases, **_the old filling_** is removed and the tooth is treated as we described above. The difference is that retreatment often takes more time, as the filling is hard and difficult to remove.

Root canal treatment is an important procedure that can save your tooth and **_prevent the spread of inflammation_**, which can be dangerous to the entire body. With our **_modern technology and experienced team_**, we offer high-quality treatment with a minimal number of visits. Contact us today to learn more.
