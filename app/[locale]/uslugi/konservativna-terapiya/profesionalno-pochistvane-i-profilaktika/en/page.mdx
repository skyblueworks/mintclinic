## What is Professional Teeth Cleaning?

Professional teeth cleaning (or scaling and polishing) is a procedure in which a dentist or hygienist removes accumulated plaque and tartar from the surface of teeth and below the gum line. This is particularly important because tartar cannot be removed with regular tooth brushing.

## Benefits of Professional Cleaning

- **Prevention of Cavities and Gingivitis -** Plaque and tartar contain bacteria that can cause cavities and gum inflammation.
- **Fresh Breath -** Accumulated plaque and bacteria are a common cause of bad breath.
- **Improved Aesthetics -** Professional tooth polishing removes surface stains from food and beverages, restoring the natural whiteness of teeth.
- **Healthy Gums -** Regular cleaning helps prevent the development of gingivitis and periodontitis while improving gum health.

## How Often Should Professional Cleaning and Preventive Care Be Performed?

It is recommended that professional cleaning be performed **twice a year**, but the frequency may vary depending on the individual oral health condition of the patient. People with periodontal disease or a greater tendency to form tartar may require more frequent visits.
