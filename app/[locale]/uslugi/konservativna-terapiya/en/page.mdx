## Conservative Therapy: Preserving Natural Teeth

Conservative therapy is the foundational level of dental medicine. It is a primary approach aimed at preventing and treating dental diseases while maximizing the preservation of their structural integrity. If a tooth cannot be saved conservatively, then we proceed to prosthodontics or surgery. Conservative therapy includes various procedures designed to prevent cavity development, restore damaged teeth, and improve oral hygiene.
