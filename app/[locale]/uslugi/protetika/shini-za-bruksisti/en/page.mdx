## Night Guards for Bruxism | Effective Solution for Protection Against Teeth Grinding and Clenching

Bruxism, or involuntary **_teeth grinding and clenching_**, is a common condition that can cause serious tooth wear and strain on the jaw joint. One of the most effective methods for preventing damage caused by bruxism is wearing a **_bruxism night guard_**. These guards are used **_primarily at night_** and serve to protect the teeth and relieve tension in the jaw muscles.

## What Are Bruxism Night Guards?

Bruxism night guards are plastic appliances that are placed over the teeth to protect them from **_direct contact_** during grinding or clenching. They don't stop the bruxism action itself, but **_significantly reduce the damage_** to the teeth and relieve symptoms of **_jaw tension_**.

The guards are custom-made for each patient after taking an impression of the teeth, to ensure precise fit and comfort.

Many people don't realize they suffer from bruxism until they begin experiencing jaw pain, headaches, or notice tooth wear. If left untreated, bruxism can lead to:

- Tooth enamel wear
- Tooth sensitivity
- Cracked or broken teeth
- Jaw pain and TMJ (temporomandibular joint) dysfunction
- Headaches and facial pain
