## What is a Dental Crown?

A dental crown is a prosthetic "cap" that completely covers a damaged or weakened tooth. It restores its shape, size, strength, and appearance. The most commonly used crowns are porcelain ones, as they offer a natural and aesthetic look that resembles a real tooth.

### When is a Crown Necessary?

A dental crown may be recommended in the following cases:

- **Broken or severely damaged tooth:** If a large part of the tooth has been destroyed, or it has a large filling, the crown provides additional protection and stability.
- **After root canal treatment:** Following endodontic treatment, the tooth may become more fragile, and therefore in most cases it is advisable to place a crown.
- **Aesthetic reasons:** Crowns are also used to correct defects in the shape, size, or color of teeth.
- **Functional corrections:** When the morphology (shape) of teeth is disrupted, important functionality is also lost.
