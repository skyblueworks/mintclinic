## Inlays and Onlays: Precise Tooth Restoration

Inlays and onlays are **_precision ceramic restorations_** used for **_tooth restoration_** with moderate to severe damage, when a regular filling is not sufficient, but a crown is not necessary. These custom-made restorations provide both strength and natural aesthetics to the teeth while preserving more of their natural structure.

## What are Inlays and Onlays?

- **Inlay:** An inlay is used to restore the chewing surface of a tooth when the damage does not extend to the tooth walls. It fills the cavity between the dental cusps and is fabricated to fit perfectly in the damaged area.
- **Onlay:** An onlay is larger, covering not only the chewing surface but also one or more of the tooth walls. It is ideal for restoring the lost tooth morphology as well as the bite height.

## When are Inlays and Onlays Needed?

Inlays and onlays are suitable in the following cases:

- **Moderate Cavities:** When the cavity is too large for a regular filling but doesn't yet require a crown.
- **Fractured or Worn Tooth:** If the tooth is partially fractured or worn but its structure is preserved, an inlay or onlay can provide additional strength.
- **Functional Rehabilitation:** With extensive tooth wear, the bite balance is disrupted, which can result in joint damage.
- **Replacement of Old Fillings:** Inlays and onlays can be used to replace old, worn fillings, providing a more durable and aesthetic solution.
