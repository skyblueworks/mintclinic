## What is a dental bridge?

A dental bridge is a solution for replacing **_one or more_** missing teeth. It consists of **_two or more_** crowns that are connected and attached to the adjacent healthy teeth. It solves the problem by covering the **_cosmetic defect_** of the missing tooth, protects neighboring teeth from shifting, and provides a chewing or cutting surface respectively.

The fabrication of bridges involves **_filing down adjacent teeth_**, which subsequently bear the mechanical load. Unfortunately, this introduces new potential problems over time – **_bone loss_** at the site of the missing root, or issues with the **_supporting teeth_**. The only alternative that resolves such problems is **_dental implant placement_**.

### Advantages of dental implants

- **Natural look and feel:** Dental implants blend with your natural teeth and provide a perfect aesthetic appearance.
- **Durability and strength:** With proper care, they can last a lifetime, unlike other solutions such as bridges and dentures.
- **Improved oral health:** They stimulate the jawbone and prevent its atrophy, which often occurs with missing teeth, bridges, and especially dentures.
- **Comfort and function:** Implants are firmly anchored in the jaw and allow you to speak, chew, and smile without concern.
