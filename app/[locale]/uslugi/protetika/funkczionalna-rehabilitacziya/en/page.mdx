## Functional Rehabilitation: Restoring Oral Health and Function

Functional rehabilitation is a **_comprehensive approach_** to restoring the complete functionality of **_teeth, jaw, and bite_**. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is often caused by excessive stress or **_improper bite_** resulting from tooth wear. This frequently manifests as pain. Functional rehabilitation includes a combination of **_various dental procedures_** such as crowns, onlays, implants, and even orthodontic treatment to achieve **_balance between aesthetics and health._**

## When is functional rehabilitation necessary?

Functional rehabilitation is recommended in the following cases:

- **Multiple missing teeth:** Missing teeth lead to disrupted bite and chewing difficulties, which can cause additional jaw problems.
- **Worn or broken teeth:** Chronic tooth wear due to clenching, grinding, or bad habits can lead to bite and chewing function disorders.
- **Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction:** TMJ problems can cause jaw pain, difficulty opening the mouth, headaches, and chewing problems.
- **Improper bite:** An unbalanced bite can lead to uneven tooth wear, jaw tension, and chewing problems.

## Benefits of Functional Rehabilitation

- **Improved chewing function:** Restoring missing or damaged teeth improves the ability to chew properly and prevents gastrointestinal problems.
- **Reduced pain and discomfort:** Treatment of temporomandibular joint problems or improper bite can reduce jaw tension and headaches.
- **Prevention of future damage:** Correcting the bite and restoring damaged teeth prevents their further wear and the risk of tooth loss.
- **Long-lasting results:** Functional rehabilitation provides stability and long-lasting results that can be maintained with proper care and regular dental checkups.
