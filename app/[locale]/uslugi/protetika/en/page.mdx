## What is Prosthetics?

Prosthetics is focused on restoring lost teeth and improving the chewing function, aesthetics, and comfort of patients. It includes the placement of crowns, bridges, implants, and various types of dentures that replace missing teeth and restore balance in the oral cavity. Disrupted balance, left uncorrected for a long time, often leads to overloading and wear of compensating systems, namely - the remaining teeth, chewing muscles and joints, creating difficult-to-treat conditions.
