## Dental Dentures

Dental dentures are an effective solution for people who have lost **_some or all of their teeth_**. They are removable structures made from a pink plastic base in which plastic teeth are secured. This way, dentures remain lightweight while being sufficiently strong and able to **_mimic a natural appearance_**.

## Types of Dental Dentures

There are several main types of dental dentures that can be used depending on the patient's specific needs:

- **Complete (Full) Dentures -** Used when **_all teeth_** in the upper or lower jaw are lost. They completely cover the gums and are held in place primarily through **_suction_** (negative pressure).
- **Partial Dentures -** Suitable for patients who have remaining healthy teeth. Partial dentures attach to natural teeth and fill in the gaps.
- **Implant-Supported Dentures -** This is the most modern and stable solution. Implants serve as a foundation for securing the denture, providing significantly better **_stability and comfort_** compared to traditional removable dentures.

# Disadvantages of Dental Dentures

<CardGrid>
  <Card>

### Accelerated Bone Resorption

In areas where the denture rests on the gum and uses it as support, the denture **_exerts pressure_**. The bone doesn't tolerate pressure well and consequently **_resorbs_** more quickly.

  <Card>

### Need for Adaptation

Initially, patients may experience discomfort or difficulty wearing dentures until they get used to them.

  <Card>

### Maintenance and Care

Dentures require regular cleaning and proper care to prevent infections and unpleasant odors.

  </Card>
  <Card>

### Possible Instability

With removable dentures, slight displacement may occur during chewing or speaking, especially if they are not properly fitted. A common cause is the changing bone beneath them, which in advanced stages can lead to breakage. This is why follow-up appointments are extremely important.

## Implant-Supported Dentures: A More Lasting Solution

For patients seeking a more stable and lasting solution, **_implant-supported dentures_** offer an ideal balance between comfort and functionality. Implants serve as a **_stable foundation_** for securing the denture, which significantly reduces the risk of displacement and **_improves quality of life_**. This solution is more durable over time and provides a more natural feel, while simultaneously **_preventing bone loss_** in the jaw.

Certainly, **_the best solution_** with regard to health, function, aesthetics, and above all quality of life are **_fixed permanent structures on implants_**. They mimic the natural appearance of teeth most effectively.
