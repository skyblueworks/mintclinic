## Restore Your Smile's Health and Aesthetics

Gum recession is a condition in which the gums **_recede from the teeth_**, exposing their roots. This not only compromises the aesthetics of your smile but can also lead to **_sensitivity_**, increased risk of cavities, and even tooth loss. Fortunately, gum recession coverage is an effective procedure that can restore both gum health and a beautiful smile.

### What Causes Gum Recession?

- **Improper brushing technique:** Excessive pressure when brushing teeth (mechanical irritation) can damage the gums, causing them to recede.
- **Periodontal diseases:** Infections such as gingivitis or periodontitis can destroy gum tissue.
- **Genetic predisposition:** Some people are more prone to recession due to genetic factors. However, the process can be slowed with regular cleanings.
- **Poor oral hygiene:** The buildup of plaque and bacteria can lead to inflammation and subsequent gum recession.

## What is Gum Recession Coverage?

- Maintain excellent oral hygiene by using a soft toothbrush and gentle movements.
- Follow your dentist's instructions for using prescribed mouth rinse products.
- Visit your dentist regularly for checkups and professional cleanings.
