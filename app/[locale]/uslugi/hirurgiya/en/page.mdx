## Dental Surgery | What It Is, Why You Shouldn't Be Afraid, and How to Care After the Procedure

By definition, surgery is any intervention that involves disrupting the integrity of tissue layers in the human body. By this logic, even a simple filling is a surgical procedure, but we don't classify it as such. The word "surgery" itself instills fear in most people. In today's world, this fear is unjustified.

### Why You Shouldn't Be Afraid of Dental Surgery?

Dental surgery has advanced significantly over the years, and modern methods make procedures safer, faster, and painless. Here are several reasons not to be afraid:

- **Modern Technology**: We use equipment that makes procedures minimally invasive and faster, which promotes quicker recovery.
- **Local Anesthesia**: All surgical interventions are performed under local anesthesia, which completely eliminates pain during the procedure.
- **Short Recovery Period**: In most cases, recovery after dental surgery is relatively quick, and patients can return to their normal lives after a few days.
- **We're Always Available**: We'll ensure you receive all necessary instructions and guidance for post-operative care, as well as prevention of complications. If there's a problem, we'll always respond, whether it's a holiday or a workday. That rhymed nicely.

### No Cigarettes!!!

Perhaps the most common disappointment for patients after surgery. Cigarettes significantly **dry out the oral cavity**, which is a major prerequisite for wound infection.
