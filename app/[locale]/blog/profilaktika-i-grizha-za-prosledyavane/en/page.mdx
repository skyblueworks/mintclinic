# Prevention and Follow-up Care

<p className="underline">Reading time: 5 minutes</p>

We can confidently state that prevention is one of the most important aspects of dental health care. Naturally, this is a focus of our efforts as well.

If you want to save time and money at the dentist, the best approach is to visit your dentist regularly.

As long as the cleaning and preventive examination are performed thoroughly enough, carefully enough, and the dentist takes the procedure seriously and pays attention to all the details.

At Mint, we place great emphasis on the high quality of preventive care we offer and maintain a strict protocol for all related stages of the procedure, namely:

- Taking a comprehensive status including general oral and periodontal status and discussing it with the patient
- Staining dental plaque for diagnostic purposes, monitoring, and training in proper techniques for using floss, interdental brushes, and various types of toothbrushes
- Photo documentation for diagnostic purposes and monitoring of processes
- In severe cases of periodontal disease, we also use special DNA tests and antibiograms to identify the causative agents of infections
- Discussing with the patient all subjective sensations related to their dental health

It's good to know that it is precisely during the preventive ultrasonic cleaning that all teeth, the contacts between them, and the condition of the gums can be best examined, and even the smallest cavities or defects in existing fillings, crowns, or other structures in a patient's mouth can be detected—issues that could cause problems in the future.

## Whitening

When you achieve your desired tooth whiteness, you'll feel very happy and look wonderful both in person and in photos—fresher and younger.

The challenge will be maintaining that effect over time.

At Mint, we support your efforts in this direction and will say this—we guarantee the success of our work through follow-up and prevention.

If you choose to have office whitening with us, at every subsequent scheduled preventive visit every 6 months, we will provide you with complimentary whitening gel to help you maintain the achieved results.

That's why for us, whitening is not just a procedure related to aesthetics. We also recognize whitening as a procedure that has a preventive aspect.
