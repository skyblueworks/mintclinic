# Dental Implant Consultation. How to Ensure Our Meeting with the Dentist Was Comprehensive.

If for any reason you believe you need dental implants and have an upcoming consultation with a dentist – here's what you should generally expect and receive:

During the consultation, the dentist needs to assess whether you are a suitable "candidate" for implant placement. To start with, you should have a panoramic X-ray of your jaw and possibly of the specific areas where implants need to be placed, so they can be examined and a treatment plan can be proposed. Your overall health status should also be discussed to determine if there are any contraindications for implant placement or conditions that need to be monitored during the procedures or healing period.

This is also the most appropriate time to ask all your questions or share any concerns you may have. After the consultation, a treatment plan should be presented along with alternatives, if they are available.
This treatment plan should clearly explain:

- the different stages of the proposed treatment
- the duration of the healing period after implantation
- any potential need for additional examinations
- all cost aspects

It's very important for the patient to understand what final result they can expect after implant placement – which of their problems will be resolved – aesthetic, functional, or health-related. The parameters of follow-up care should also be clearly defined regarding check-ups and preventive examinations, hygiene, and harmful habits.

It's important that you feel comfortable and that the dentist allocates sufficient time for the consultation. It's good to give yourself time to consider the proposed treatments. If you have additional questions, it's best to ask your dentist before the actual procedures begin. And of course, there are no unnecessary or awkward questions – it's perfectly appropriate to ask your dentist about their qualifications and experience, the materials they work with, and the implants themselves in terms of types, manufacturers, and prices. Last but not least – it's completely natural if you feel the need to meet with another dentist for a second opinion to ensure you're making the right choice.

At Mint Clinic, all of this is part of our standard for quality treatment. It's important to us to work with well-informed patients who are calm and motivated to begin their treatment and maintain the results achieved from it.
