# How Mint Works

<p className="underline">Reading time: 5 minutes</p>

</div>

We're delighted that you've chosen to trust us and begin your consultations and treatment with us.

We have immense respect for all our patients, dentists, dental assistants, and staff at Mint Clinic. We value their time and believe in maintaining professional relationships.

Over time, we've developed several guidelines to help ensure a smooth workflow, and we feel it's important to share them with you right from **your first visit to Mint Clinic**.

## Choosing Your Dentist and Scheduling Appointments

We make every effort to have each first-time patient receive a consultative examination with Dr. Haralampiev, so that specific issues can be identified and a treatment plan proposal can be developed. As our lead dentist, he monitors and oversees all stages of complex treatments.

Subsequent appointments are scheduled according to the treatment plan sequence, available appointment slots with the appropriate dental specialist, and your personal availability.

Our clinic schedule is busy, so we would greatly appreciate it if you need to miss a scheduled appointment, please notify us at least 1 day in advance. This allows us to offer the freed-up slot to another patient and prevents us from wasting the time of our dentists and assistants.

We cannot afford to tolerate situations where appointment cancellations become a frequent practice. After several missed appointments, we will ask you to prepay for the planned procedure at your next visit.

## 2. First Visit

At our first meeting, we'll ask you for some personal information – we need to know the best way to communicate with you, as well as minimal medical history that may be relevant to our work – allergies, current therapies, and the issues you've described in advance to assist the dentist during the initial examination. For your convenience and ours, you can download and complete the new patient form from the Contact page on our website: www.mintclinic.com

## 3. Treatment Plan

We have a practice of providing treatment plans to patients who are beginning more extensive and comprehensive restorations. The treatment plan includes a description of the procedures we propose to perform, how they will be distributed over time, as well as the approximate cost and stages at which we expect payments from you. Treatment begins after you formally approve the proposed plan.

## 4. Payments

You can pay in cash, by card, or by bank transfer.

Your dentist is committed to discussing with you the cost of the proposed procedures, and you are welcome to ask us any questions.

Each procedure is paid at reception after it has been completed. If a procedure is performed over several visits, an advance payment of 50% of the expected cost should be made for the treatment that has begun.

For complex treatments, the stages at which payments are expected are outlined in advance. If payment cannot be made in a given situation, we will ask you to sign the corresponding financial document.

At Mint Clinic, we can issue invoices for payments made and prepare documents that you can submit to various insurers. It's best to request this in advance and provide us with the requirements of the respective companies in the form of various forms that need to be completed by the dentist or administrator.

## 5. Informed Consents

In accordance with good medical practices worldwide, for your peace of mind and our security, we will ask you to sign informed consent forms for the different types of proposed procedures. If you have specific questions, please ask your dentist. These forms will be the foundation of the trust you should have in the people who will be caring for your health.

## 6. Follow-up Care

Follow-up care is one of the core values in Mint Clinic's philosophy. Upon completion of treatments, we insist on monitoring the achieved results over time. This is the only way we can be sure we'll succeed in preserving them for the long term. With this in mind, we will ask you to indicate the most convenient and effective way for us to remind you of upcoming preventive check-ups.

Thank you for your attention
and your trust!
