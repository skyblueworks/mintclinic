# Occlusion and Bite Balance

<p className="underline">Reading time: 10 minutes</p>

Occlusion is the scientific term that encompasses the concept of how the surfaces of our teeth meet when we close our mouth, bite, chew, speak, sleep, swallow (or don't swallow for extended periods), or grind our teeth.

To achieve lasting results after any treatment – with implants, prosthetic work, orthodontic treatment, and even endodontic procedures – the most important factor is balancing the bite.

This is a very delicate and complex process that is often neglected in mainstream dental care. It requires very high qualifications, experience, and intuition from the dentist themselves.

## Prevention and Symptoms

If the chewing surfaces of the teeth fit precisely, the dental arches are properly aligned, and there are no missing teeth, there are no occlusal problems present. This condition is considered normal. Often the balance is disrupted imperceptibly – a filling appears that's too high, which you get used to over time, a tooth is extracted and neighboring teeth shift, sometimes opposing teeth overerupt. This doesn't hurt, and it happens so slowly over time that it's accepted as part of the changes occurring with natural aging processes.

During your preventive checkups, if your dentist notices something irregular with your bite, they should clearly explain to you in understandable language what is currently happening, what the causes are, and what the consequences might be. They should also explain what can be done in your specific situation. And you should ask all the questions that interest you so you can make an informed decision.

If for some reason the conversation about the bite hasn't happened and it isn't balanced, at some point the body itself will give signals that something is wrong – there may be tension in the jaw muscles, clicking of the jaw joints, numbness or spontaneously fractured teeth or fillings, prolonged teeth grinding, even neck pain.

## Problems

What unbalanced bites can lead to

The muscles that move our jaws are among the strongest in the human body – we use them constantly.

If the movements of these muscles and joints are disrupted and our bite is problematic, it can lead to extremely severe tooth wear, occlusal trauma, tooth fractures, root surface exposure or so-called recessions, tooth displacement, overeruption. As a result, it can lead to loss of individual teeth, entire arches, or bone.

## Analysis

To achieve adequate solutions, it's very important that bite problems be adequately analyzed. Because we're dealing with a truly complex and comprehensive process, detailed methods of examination are required. Fortunately, they are not associated with patient discomfort, but sometimes take more time.

It begins with taking impressions from which so-called "diagnostic models" for analysis are made. They are placed in a special device called an articulator, which should simulate the movements of the joints and show how the teeth interact in the patient's mouth. In this process, the experience and competencies of the dentist and dental technician at every step are of utmost importance – "facebow," determining "centric relation," relaxing the lower jaw (romancing the mandible), transfer and mounting in the articulator, and other complex moments.

Only after such specific analysis can clarity about the nature of the problem be achieved and consequently adequate solution options.

## Solutions

Solutions to occlusion problems can be surprisingly simple or impressively complex, depending on individual cases. To achieve optimal solutions in more complex situations, individual solution design is required – wax-up and mock-up. Simply put, this involves creating temporary elements and constructions that can be tried and adjusted in the patient's mouth until the desired result is achieved – tooth shape and length. This effect can also be achieved by creating a digital photo project (digital smile design), but only with the actual wax project (wax-up) are all important additional dimensions tested – functionality, volume, articulation during speech and movement, smile line, comfort in the patient's mouth, and many others (video)

In some mild cases, you may feel significant relief even when just a few points are ground down on existing tooth surfaces to release the so-called "proper contacts." If your dentist is well-trained and precise in their work, in less than an hour they can make a significant change in status and alleviate your symptoms.

Quite often, however, there is a need for comprehensive solutions that require a combined approach – orthodontic alignment of dental arches, raising the bite itself in cases of already severely worn teeth with prosthetic work (replacement or creation of crowns and fillings with adequate surfaces), and subsequent equilibration and placement of aligners or retainers, fabrication of splints for bruxism.
