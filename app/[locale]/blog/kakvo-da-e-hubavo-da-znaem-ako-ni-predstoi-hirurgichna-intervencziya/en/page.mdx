## Useful Information for Patients

What happens and how it happens when a surgical procedure is necessary – tooth extraction, implantation, sinus lift, connective tissue graft.

## 1\. Preparation

After consultation, your dentist schedules the necessary imaging examination and discusses the results with you, takes your medical history, and makes a diagnosis. This is a conversation where you inform your dentist about your medical history – already diagnosed conditions such as allergies, chronic diseases, and their accompanying medical documentation. They explain the necessity and expected outcome of the proposed procedure, and you discuss alternative options.

You'll receive clarification regarding the cost, approximate time for completing the procedure, and a brief description of the process. You can ask all the questions that interest you. This is the moment to share all your concerns and worries with your dentist.

You may request to be sedated during the procedure. We can provide a highly qualified and experienced anesthesiologist to help you relax so the procedure can be completed without any memory of it.

If you agree – we'll schedule a convenient appointment time for you. When planning your time, keep in mind that after the operation itself, the dentist will schedule irrigations, suture removal, and follow-up examinations depending on the speed of the healing process – in this sense, it would be unrealistic to plan a vacation with bungee jumping the next day.

Before the operation itself, you'll receive a document called "informed consent," which describes the possible consequences of the proposed procedure. You should read it carefully and again – if you have questions, ask your dentist. We'll ask you to sign it before starting the planned work.

You may need to start antibiotic treatment one day before the intervention; the doctor will explain why. In this case, it's good to also start taking probiotics, spacing the intake of probiotics and antibiotics at least two hours apart. It's recommended to continue taking probiotics for several days after the last antibiotic dose.

## 2\. The Operation Itself

The best moment for a selfie with the doctor is when you're already dressed in a sterile gown and cap. It's fun, distracts from the slight nervousness before surgery, and people don't usually have many other photos in such attire... at this stage, it's good to establish a way to communicate with the team beforehand in case you want to report any discomfort.

It begins with administering local anesthetics traditionally used for this purpose (ubistesine, septanest, mepivastesine). These will completely numb the intervention site. We also have anesthesia for the anesthesia – the injection itself for administering local anesthesia can be unpleasant, so a gel is applied to the corresponding area to eliminate this sensation. During the operation, you'll have a sensation of touch and pressure, but not pain. If unpleasant sensations appear, an additional amount of anesthesia can always be added.

If the procedure is longer, the tension from prolonged mouth opening may be uncomfortable – in this case, if the doctor deems it necessary, they'll offer you to bite on a special soft rubber, which will provide significant relief.

If you wish, you can ask the doctor to give you brief explanations of the different stages of the process, for example: "now I'll make an incision that..."

## 3\. Recovery

After the end of the operation and the last suture, you'll be given a cold ice compress for the expected tissue swelling, and it's good to lie down and not rush to get up.

Final control X-rays will also be taken at this time.

The assistants will ask you to remain in the clinic's waiting room for a short period to be monitored. During this time, they'll give you the necessary instructions for oral hygiene after surgery and, if needed, a special brush, mouth rinse, and gel. The doctor will provide a prescription for pain relief medications suitable for you.

Before leaving, it's good to confirm with the doctor when your next visit should be. You can ask our administrative assistants to call a taxi for you.

For the next two to three hours, it's advisable not to talk, drink, or eat.

You should know that for the next 24 hours, it's absolutely contraindicated to consume hot foods and drinks, alcohol, or smoke (tobacco, cigarettes, hookah, etc.).

It's recommended to rest until the end of the day and avoid physical exertion and visits to saunas and pools or diving, in some cases even air travel for several days. Avoid sudden contact or pressure in the operation area – sometimes a strong hug with a kiss can cause you pain or compromise the healing process. And again – if something is unclear, ask your questions without hesitation.

You will inevitably experience swelling, possibly with bruising. The condition called "trismus" – or limited ability to open the mouth – is also natural.

Generally, it's normal to be in a condition close to your usual one the next day and to perform your usual duties or go to work, of course with the caveat that there should be no physical strain.

The sutures may loosen or there may even be a little blood in the wound area; this shouldn't worry you.

It's normal to have pain for several days after the intervention, which should respond to and subside after taking the prescribed painkillers.

Cases where it's necessary to urgently contact your doctor are:

- excessive bleeding;
- pain that doesn't decrease with painkillers;
- any other atypical conditions that you associate with the intervention.

These are, of course, rare cases and you most likely won't need to visit the clinic additionally.
