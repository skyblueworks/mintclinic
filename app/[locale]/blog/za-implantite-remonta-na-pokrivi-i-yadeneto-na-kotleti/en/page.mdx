# About Implants, Roof Repairs, and Eating Cutlets

<p className="underline">Reading time: 15 minutes</p>

I'm missing quite a few teeth, and the ones I have left don't seem to be doing well at all. Over the years, I've constantly been going to the dentist, and I don't know how things got to this point – I avoid smiling, I can't eat properly, I have various bridges, even a partial denture. True, I'm not young; I know it can't be like it used to be, but it can't go on like this either. I feel like I have bad breath, and my wife doesn't deny it when I ask her.

I go to a dentist. Not just to one. I want a good solution, and as is now fashionable – I'm doing my market research too. That's right, I want to know all the possibilities and options. And to make a proper calculation this time.

They tell me I need implants. Every dentist suggests a different number. Don't these people study at the same place? Some talk to me about more serious procedures – bone grafting, something with sinuses... And how am I supposed to know if I really need so many things or if they're just looking to make more money?

One dentist claims that things can be fixed with fewer implants, some new system, ideal for people my age (when they say "my age" like that, it makes me feel bad. What's wrong with my age? We were all young once, we all get older). So about this system – it was something with fix... oh yes – "fast and fixed." Probably another advertising gimmick, because now everything is fixed this, fixed that – fixed meatball mix, fixed hair volume, fixed interest rates. There was even a nice little juice place – fix-mix. Since I can't eat carrots, at least I can have a fresh juice for vitamins.

Various people, younger ones of course, who don't yet know what it's all about, watch commercials and tell me – just get yourself a denture and you're done – a little adjustment and you'll be Eating Apples and Nuts... they know so much about what it's like to wear a denture.

Another dentist tells me that they could actually anchor my dentures on small implants. Cheaper. I got completely confused... I don't want a denture at all... I want TEETH. Like mine from way back when. And that's why I'm now thinking about implants.

But what kind of implants exactly – there are many brands – both expensive and cheap. Some dentists work with certain implants, others with different ones, and everyone praises their own. So you go ahead and choose.

And how am I supposed to know what kind of professionals these dentists are? Who has how much experience? Nowadays, implants are placed everywhere – both in fancy clinics with lots of advertising and in the neighborhood garage-office.

How do I choose who should place these implants? Some claim it's a super complicated surgery and that's why it's so expensive, while others, when you say you're scared, immediately say it's easy work and it won't even hurt. Yeah right, I've seen what it was like when a colleague had his wisdom tooth extracted. He looked like a balloon for three days. Bruised. We joked that he was perfect for an SDS rally (but those from back then, the current ones are useless).

Another problem – what do we do if there are complications? There's bound to be some, given my luck... And if it were just one implant, you could hope it would turn out fine, but when there are several, something's bound to go wrong. And what does a failed implant even mean?

So far I've understood that for the treatment to be successful, you have to wait several months before the implant is ready to bear chewing load and have a crown placed on it. It's called the osseointegration process, if I'm not mistaken. Let's just hope it's not like European integration, because look how we thought that would go, and how it turned out...

And at my age... if I were a young man, maybe it would make sense. But now to start with various surgeries, to wait... then until these teeth are done. And so much money – for what? Relatives joke with me – that I'll have excellent teeth for the other world. It's both true and not true – I feel young, maybe good years are still ahead of me. It's not like before, when you retire and stay home. Now, I'm both a retiree and still working. I want to live. And there are so many places I still want to go... European integration has its good sides too – cheap tours abroad for retirees through European programs – why shouldn't I go? Preferably after I have teeth, right, I'll want to try the local cuisine.

Other dentists tell me that the teeth that are no good could be extracted, implants placed immediately, new teeth on top, and done. I'm a bit skeptical about this quick work – won't it turn out to be a shame for the craftsman? But then again, the doctors studied, medicine has advanced. And now who am I supposed to believe: some say – you need to wait, others say – it can be done right away!

And does anyone even give me a guarantee? If something goes wrong, will they fix it for free?

Because no matter how you look at it, it's not cheap. With this money, I could repair the roof of my cottage or change my car. But everyone makes their own decision. I've decided to fix my teeth. A new car won't make it any easier for me to eat a cutlet.

And it's not that I don't have money, I do... or at least I think so, until I find out exactly how much I'll need. How can I calculate it when almost no one tells me how much everything will cost? It depends on many things, they say, decisions are made during the process. I understand it's complicated, it's not like cutting with a knife, but they could give me some approximate amount. As my wife says, at least we'd know which field from the inheritance we need to sell.

One nice dentist told me he'd write everything down in detail and send it to me. By email, if I want. I agreed, I'm keeping up with modern times, I have email. Why should I travel unnecessarily and waste his time, and mine too? I'll read the information carefully, think about what else to ask him, and do my calculations. It won't work without asking questions. Things are clear to dentists from one word, but not to us.

Otherwise, the calculation has no clear end in sight. The kids will have weddings, money is needed. On the other hand, how can I show myself without teeth... it's an ugly situation. And I can't eat well. My wife says that if I continue like this, I'll get sick. I should chew my food well; it's very easy for her. For now. She'll reach my point one day too. And she won't want to go to restaurants with friends. She's always angry with me. And I, with my bridges and partial dentures – they've become mobile! While I'm eating, everything comes out and shifts. You can't be adjusting your chompers in your mouth in front of people. Good thing they're large and I can't swallow them. I can already put one bridge back myself when it falls out. I don't even go to have it cemented anymore, the dentist keeps telling me nothing can be done about it. And back in the day when he placed it for me – it was great, right, the pinnacle of dental science... But I'm doing research for serious treatment anyway, I'll be getting implants, why should I cement this bridge?

But I'm still scared, they'll be drilling into my bone and it can't not hurt. Then swelling, stitches, waiting a long time before they place my teeth... and until then? Dentures again. I wish I'd already finished this business, I don't feel like dealing with it at all. But when should I postpone it any longer – it won't get easier or cheaper from here on out.

I'll wait to see who'll give me a total price and then I'll think. And I'll go find someone who's already had implants placed, to tell me what it's like. It's different to talk with someone who's already been through it.

And I'll take action and keep repeating to myself "Persevere, old man, for the sake of beauty." And I'll write emails to the kids, telling them to brush their teeth regularly, so they won't regret it later like me.
