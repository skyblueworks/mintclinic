Welcome to my first blog post! This is an example of how to create beautiful blog content using MDX and Tailwind's prose classes.

## Why MDX is Amazing

MDX allows you to seamlessly blend **Markdown** with _React components_, giving you the best of both worlds:

- Write content naturally with Markdown
- Embed interactive React components
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript
- Get automatic syntax highlighting

## Code Examples

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  author: string;
}

function formatDate(date: string): string {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
  });
}
```

And here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
const posts = [
  { id: 1, title: "First Post" },
  { id: 2, title: "Second Post" },
];

posts.forEach((post) => {
  console.log(post.title);
});
```

## Styling with Tailwind Prose

The `prose` classes from Tailwind Typography automatically style all your markdown content beautifully. This includes:

1. **Typography** - Perfect font sizes and line heights
2. **Colors** - Consistent color schemes
3. **Spacing** - Harmonious vertical rhythm
4. **Code blocks** - Beautiful syntax highlighting

### Features List

Here are some key features:

- Responsive design out of the box
- Dark mode support with `dark:prose-invert`
- Customizable with Tailwind utilities
- Works perfectly with MDX components
