## A Permanent Solution for Missing Teeth

Implants are **titanium screws** that are placed into the jawbone and serve as artificial tooth roots. They offer a permanent solution for replacing missing teeth and serve as a foundation for **custom-made crowns**, bridges, or dentures.

## What Are Dental Implants?

Dental implants are designed to **look and function** just like natural teeth, while simultaneously **preventing bone loss** and improving your overall oral health and quality of life.

### Benefits of Dental Implants

- **Natural Look and Feel:** Dental implants blend seamlessly with your natural teeth and provide a perfect aesthetic appearance.
- **Longevity and Strength:** With proper care, they can last a lifetime, unlike other solutions such as bridges and dentures.
- **Improved Oral Health:** They stimulate the jawbone and prevent bone resorption, which often occurs with missing teeth.
- **Comfort and Function:** Implants are firmly anchored in the jaw and allow you to speak, chew, and smile without concern.
