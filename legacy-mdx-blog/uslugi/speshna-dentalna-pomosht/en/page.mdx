## When is Emergency Dental Care Needed?

Emergency dental care is necessary in a number of situations that can affect the teeth, gums, or soft tissues of the oral cavity. Some of the most common emergencies include:

- **Severe Toothache -** If you're experiencing intense pain that isn't relieved by painkillers, this may be a sign of infection, deep cavity, or root canal problem.
- **Broken or Knocked-Out Tooth -** Physical trauma caused by impacts or falls can lead to tooth fracture or even tooth loss. In such cases, immediate intervention is important for saving the tooth.
- **Abscess -** Painful gum swelling may be a sign of an abscess, which represents an infection and can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.
- **Heavy Gum Bleeding -** Prolonged or heavy bleeding from the gums after trauma or a procedure may require emergency dental care. Lost filling or crown – Loss of a filling or crown can leave the tooth vulnerable to infections and additional damage, requiring emergency replacement or restoration.
- **Jaw or Lip Injuries -** A blow to the face or accidents can cause injuries to the jaw, lips, and soft tissues, which also require quick dental intervention.
