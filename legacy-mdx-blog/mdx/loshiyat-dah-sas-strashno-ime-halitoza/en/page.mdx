How to tell someone close to you that they have bad breath. Without offending them. And in a way that they understand correctly and take care of themselves.

When HALITOSIS is lingering around us. In all cases, it's very difficult to tell someone they have a problem with their breath. Even when it comes to a very close person. It's even more unpleasant when it happens to be a colleague at work. Here are several possible ways to approach the problem. We need to choose the most appropriate one depending on the situation, because none promises guaranteed success:

- Offer gum or a mint candy – it's not certain whether the hint will be correctly understood, not everyone has heard the golden rule "if someone offers you gum, take it, you most likely need it"
- Send/leave an anonymous note or email – yes, the message will be communicated, but we risk the recipient starting to spend a large part of their work time wondering and trying to figure out who sent it, and unpleasant feelings toward every suspected sender will certainly arise. It might turn out that we'll replace the old problem with a new one – instead of bad breath in the workplace, a bad atmosphere will appear.
- Tell the person directly – I don't know if you remember the Bulgarian folk tale "A Bad Word Is Not Forgotten," where a woodcutter became so friendly with a bear that he allowed himself to tell her that "her breath smells bad." And to this day they teach our children that it's better to keep quiet in such a moment, so as not to cause offense.
- Tell a story in which the main character isn't aware they have bad breath. They can't understand why sometimes the perfect deal falls through for no reason and the great person they met recently also no longer calls. Friends happen to tell them about a good dentist and they realize it's been a long time since they had a checkup. They book an appointment. Happy End!
- You can try to cite statistical data or studies about what percentage of people have bad breath and hope that the hint will be understood correctly.

We also suggest something else. Try to conduct the conversation on a slightly more rational level. As long as you have reason to think that the person in front of you might try to react rationally.

We can start in the first person. Here's an example of an opening line:
"You know, if I have parsley between my teeth, an unzipped fly, a run in my tights, or bad breath, I'd prefer someone to tell me so I can stop embarrassing myself. It won't be pleasant and I'll be embarrassed, but I'll still be grateful. What do you think – would you want someone to be direct with you in such a moment and tell you if something's wrong?"

And if the answer is yes, from there on it's easy) And for the dialogue to make sense, the next step is to understand what the most common causes are and accordingly what we can do to eliminate bad breath.

Today there's a lot of information about what halitosis is and what causes it. We'll try to be as brief and useful as possible. And to emphasize that most often, but not always, the cause is in the way you care for your teeth.

CAUSE: We feel that lately we haven't been particularly diligent with our oral hygiene.

WHAT TO DO: We start with brushing our teeth for at least 3 minutes after every meal, yes... we buy dental floss. And we start using it regularly. It may be necessary to use interdental brushes. A tongue cleaning brush or more specifically a "scraper." Yes, plaque also accumulates on the tongue and it's an ideal place for bacteria to develop. Fact – it's complicated and tedious. But the stakes are high – fresh breath!

CAUSE: We suspect problems with our teeth and gums, we haven't been to the dentist in a long time.

WHAT TO DO: We book an appointment with the dentist for an examination and cleaning of dental plaque. During the examination, we emphasize that we have problems with bad breath. The dentist takes things into their own hands.

CAUSE: We love spicy foods and those that "leave" a taste and smell in our body – onions, garlic, different types of spices like curry.

WHAT TO DO: In this case, gum, brushing teeth, and using mouthwash can slightly mask bad breath, but we need to be aware that if we've eaten tripe with lots of garlic and we have a work meeting coming up, one piece of gum won't fix the situation. It simply takes quite a bit of time for our body to process these foods and "eliminate" them from the body. In this sense, if you love such foods, you'll need to choose the right moment for consumption or consciously endure all the consequences)

CAUSE: Summer is coming and it's very important to regain good physical shape. Attention, if you switch to some highly restrictive diet or start exhausting workouts without getting carbohydrates, it's possible to change your metabolism in such a way that besides the desired effect (weight loss) you also get a side effect – bad breath.

WHAT TO DO: In short – we need to keep one thing in mind – we need to be very well informed and try to balance when we're on a diet or starting intense training. We compensate with rhythmic and proper eating according to the situation.

CAUSE: Smoking. There's no point in explaining why and how breath changes if we smoke.

WHAT TO DO: It's best not to smoke, of course. But if we still have reasons to do it, we need to be aware that we should always have gum on hand, brush our teeth more often, and use mouthwash. Regularly.

CAUSE: Dry mouth. Insufficient amounts of saliva in the mouth inevitably lead to bad breath. Dry mouth can be caused by simple things – insufficient water intake, but also by the use of various types of medications (for example antidepressants), a stuffy nose, and prolonged mouth breathing.

WHAT TO DO: In general, it's important to drink plenty of fluids. If the problem is medical, we need to consult with the treating physician.

CAUSE: Bad breath can also be caused by untreated medical conditions, namely, problems with the salivary glands, respiratory tract, bronchitis, pneumonia, inflamed tonsils, chronic sinusitis, diabetes, liver problems, kidneys, reflux, and Helicobacter pylori.

WHAT TO DO: In such a case, of course it's important to see a doctor and while the respective treatment is ongoing, to use again sugar-free gum and candies and drink fluids. All of this – with the aim of moisturizing the mouth.

CAUSE: Morning bad breath. It's caused by nighttime dry mouth, which is something normal. It causes short-term damage only to those closest to you)

WHAT TO DO: The good news is that it disappears quickly after breakfast. So – eat breakfast and drink more fluids! The bad news is that we can get confused and reassure ourselves that we only have morning bad breath. When in fact it's all-day.
P.S. With a smile, we must emphasize that this isn't about bad breath in the morning as a result of a hangover, when we often self-prescribe treatment with tripe soup, which already puts us in a vicious circle))

Let's hope that if we have to raise the issue of bad breath or someone turns to us, there won't be any offended parties. We'll simply make ourselves a cup of mint tea – a very good remedy for freshening breath) – and it will be a pleasant and useful conversation for everyone.
