# What We Would Tell You at Mint About Dental Sealants

Dental sealants are a very interesting topic in pediatric dental health prevention.

What are dental sealants – when a child's first permanent molars emerge in the mouth, they don't have fully completed mineralization and their enamel isn't strong enough. Their chewing surface isn't smooth, but grooved. The small folds, grooves and pits (fissures) are narrow and deep, with irregular shapes. Plaque and microorganisms get trapped in them. The sealant procedure itself involves sealing the fissures with special varnishes and gels to protect the teeth from cavities. The World Health Organization, as well as most national health organizations, recommend this procedure and make it a central focus of pediatric cavity prevention programs. The statistical data presented fully support the value of sealants on a mass level.

Unfortunately, dental sealants cannot be completely effective in all cases and for extended periods. Our experience shows that tooth fissures cannot be completely cleaned of plaque and microorganisms before being "sealed." Particles remain trapped in the miniature curves of the fissures that cannot simply be "cleaned" (if all prerequisites for cavity formation under the sealant were to be removed, the "cleaning" would constitute a surface filling). As a result of individual and long-term follow-ups, it turns out that cavities form under some of these so-called "sealants." The danger in this case is that sometimes after applying sealants, preventive care isn't particularly active precisely because people rely on the sealing effect, and cavities under sealants remain untreated for long periods and can lead to pulpitis or even worse, tooth loss.

You can see photos of teeth from our young patients who had sealants placed. It's clearly visible how cavities have already formed under the "sealed" surface.

At Mint, we choose to skip sealants for our own children. Our alternative is to ensure adequate oral hygiene, preventive care and monitoring.
